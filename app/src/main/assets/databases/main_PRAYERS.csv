forgive me my sins;
the sins of my youth,
the sins of my age,
the sins of my soul,
the sins of my body;
my idle sins,
my serious voluntary sins;
the sins I know,
the sins I do not know;
the sins I have concealed for so long,
and which are now hidden from my memory.

I am truly sorry for every sin,
mortal and venial,
for all the sins of my childhood
up to the present hour.

I know my sins have wounded
thy tender heart,
O my Savior, let me be freed
from the bonds of evil
through the most bitter
Passion of my redeemer.

6,Act of Contrition (St. Gertrude),"O my most loving Father,
in the bitterness of the
dolorous Passion of Jesus Christ,
thy Son,
I now pour forth my complaint,
indignantly accusing myself that
I have served thee so unfaithfully
during this day
and have offended thee,
my most amiable and loving Father,
by so many and so great negligences.
I grieve for them from my inmost heart,
and strike my breast
in the spirit of compunction,
and say unto thee, O God!
be merciful to me, a sinner.
And for all the negligences whereby
I have extinguished thy good
and gentle Spirit within me,
I offer thee the sufferings
and the tears of thy beloved Son.
I beseech thee,
in union with his most availing prayers,
to grant me pardon of my sins
and to supply all my defects.
Deign to hear this, my prayer,
through that love which held back
thine arm from taking vengeance,
when thine only
and most beloved Son,
the object of Thine eternal
and unspeakable complacency,
was numbered with transgressors.

Amen.

8,Apostles' Creed,"I believe in God, the Father almighty,
creator of Heaven and earth;
and in Jesus Christ,
his only Son, our Lord,
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died, and was buried;
He descended into Hell.  The third day
he rose again from the dead;
he ascended into Heaven,
and sits at the right hand of God,
the Father almighty;
from thence he shall come to judge
the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy Catholic Church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body
and life everlasting.
